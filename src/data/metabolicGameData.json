  "functionDescriptions": {
    "Ti": "the architect of internal logic, constructing frameworks of understanding that must satisfy the mind's demand for coherence and precision. This function dissects reality into its component principles, seeking the underlying structure that governs how things truly work. It is the relentless questioner of assumptions, the detector of inconsistencies, the craftsperson who refines ideas until they achieve crystalline clarity. Ti operates like a master jeweler, examining each facet of a concept under intense scrutiny, polishing away impurities until only essential truth remains. It values accuracy over speed, depth over breadth, and will sacrifice social harmony for the integrity of its reasoning.",
    "Te": "the orchestrator of external reality, transforming abstract potential into concrete achievement through systematic action and strategic coordination. This function sees the world as a vast project waiting for efficient organization, identifying what needs to be done and marshaling resources to accomplish it with maximum effectiveness. It is the natural leader that emerges in chaos, the planner who maps routes from current state to desired outcome, the implementer who turns vision into measurable results. Te operates like a conductor before a symphony, understanding how each element must contribute to the whole, timing each movement for optimal impact while maintaining momentum toward the final crescendo.",
    "Fi": "the guardian of inner truth, maintaining an unwavering compass of personal values that guides authentic expression and genuine connection. This function creates a sanctuary of meaning within the self, where experiences are filtered through the lens of what truly matters, what resonates with the core essence of who one is. It is the discriminating force that knows instantly what feels right or wrong, the protector of individual uniqueness, the source of compassionate understanding that extends naturally to others who share similar depths. Fi operates like a master vintner, allowing experiences to age and deepen until they transform into wisdom, creating something uniquely valuable that cannot be rushed or artificially produced.",
    "Fe": "the weaver of collective harmony, sensing the emotional atmosphere of groups and adjusting its own expression to create connection, understanding, and shared purpose. This function reads the subtle currents of feeling that flow between people, instinctively knowing what will bring others together or drive them apart. It is the natural diplomat that finds common ground, the host that makes everyone feel welcome, the emotional translator who helps different perspectives understand each other. Fe operates like a skilled conductor of human symphony, drawing out the best in each individual while creating something greater than the sum of its parts, orchestrating moments where separate hearts beat in unison.",
    "Ni": "the mystic of pattern and convergence, perceiving the hidden threads that connect seemingly unrelated phenomena into singular, inevitable truths. This function operates in the realm of symbolic understanding, where disparate information crystallizes into unified vision, where the future reveals itself through present patterns. It is the oracle that sees beyond surface appearances, the synthesizer that distills complexity into essential meaning, the architect of destiny who understands how current choices shape inevitable outcomes. Ni operates like a master weaver working with invisible thread, creating tapestries of meaning that only become visible when viewed from the perfect distance, revealing designs that were always present but never before seen.",
    "Ne": "the explorer of infinite possibility, generating endless connections and alternatives by seeing potential in everything and everyone. This function treats reality as a playground of 'what if,' constantly discovering new angles, novel combinations, and previously unimaginined opportunities. It is the spark of innovation that refuses to accept limitations, the brainstormer who sees solutions where others see dead ends, the bridge-builder who connects distant ideas in ways that transform both. Ne operates like a master improviser in conversation with the universe, taking whatever reality offers and transforming it into something unexpected and delightful, turning every moment into a launching pad for new adventures.",
    "Si": "the keeper of embodied wisdom, preserving the texture of lived experience and drawing upon the accumulated knowledge of what has worked, what has failed, and what endures. This function creates a rich internal library of sensory memories and practical knowledge, understanding that the past contains invaluable guidance for navigating present challenges. It is the traditionalist who honors what has proven valuable, the craftsperson who perfects techniques through repetition, the guardian of cultural memory who ensures important knowledge is not lost. Si operates like a master curator of experience, maintaining detailed records of life's lessons and knowing precisely which wisdom to apply to each new situation.",
    "Se": "the dancer with immediate reality, engaging fully with the present moment through direct sensory experience and spontaneous response. This function lives in the eternal now, reading environmental cues with perfect timing and responding with fluid grace to whatever emerges. It is the athlete who moves without thinking, the artist who captures fleeting beauty, the responder who acts with perfect appropriateness to each unique situation. Se operates like a master performer on the stage of life, improvising brilliantly with whatever the moment provides, turning every encounter into an opportunity for authentic engagement and immediate impact."

  "results": {
    "revision": "Your cognitive metabolism moves in spirals, never satisfied with a single pass through any territory of understanding. Where others seek closure, you find openings. Your mind treats each conclusion as a temporary rest stop, returning to examine what was missed, what assumptions went unquestioned, what depths remained unplumbed. You are the eternal editor of your own experience, constantly refining not just what you think, but how you think about thinking itself. This creates a richness of perspective that others find both illuminating and occasionally exhausting. You see patterns in the revisiting - how ideas evolve when approached from different angles, how early judgments often prove incomplete. Your strength lies in this willingness to remain perpetually open, to let understanding deepen through iteration rather than crystallize prematurely. The challenge is learning when to trust a conclusion long enough to act on it, when to let the spiral settle into forward motion. Others may perceive your reconsideration as indecision, but you know it as the mark of a mind that refuses to accept surface explanations when deeper truths are available.",
    "conducting": "Your cognitive metabolism orchestrates complexity into coherent action. Like a conductor who hears the full symphony before the first note is played, you excel at mapping the territory between intention and manifestation. Your mind naturally sequences, prioritizes, and coordinates multiple elements toward unified outcomes. You are the architect of momentum, understanding that true progress requires both vision and systematic execution. Others rely on you to transform scattered possibilities into structured pathways, to create frameworks that turn abstract potential into concrete results. Your thinking moves with purposeful rhythm, building toward crescendos of achievement while maintaining awareness of each component's role in the greater composition. You see the connections that allow individual efforts to amplify rather than conflict, the timing that allows maximum impact with minimum waste. Your strength lies in this capacity to hold both the overview and the details, to maintain forward momentum without losing sight of the destination. The challenge comes when the orchestra refuses to follow the score, when human unpredictability disrupts your carefully constructed harmonies. Your gift to the world is the demonstration that chaos can be shaped into beauty through patient, skillful direction.",
    "density": "Your cognitive metabolism compresses experience into concentrated meaning, like a star collapsing matter into increasingly powerful forms. Where others skim surfaces, you dive toward centers. Your mind seeks not breadth but depth, not variety but essence. You are the deep diver of understanding, willing to descend into the pressured depths where casual explorers cannot follow. Each thought is weighted, each insight is earned through sustained focus and patient excavation. You understand that true comprehension requires time to marinate, that the most important truths cannot be rushed or superficially grasped. Your thinking has gravity - ideas orbit around core insights that you have cultivated through careful attention and relentless questioning. You see layers that others miss, connections that require stillness to perceive, patterns that only emerge when given sufficient time to develop. Your strength is this ability to go deeper when others go wider, to find the concentrated essence that illuminates everything else. The challenge is learning to surface occasionally, to translate your deep insights into forms others can access. Your gift is the demonstration that profundity is possible, that in an age of infinite distraction, the examined life still yields treasures available nowhere else.",
    "expansion": "Your cognitive metabolism explodes outward like a universe in perpetual creation, generating new possibilities faster than they can be catalogued. You are the pioneer of the impossible, the one who looks at any boundary and asks what lies beyond it. Your mind moves at the speed of inspiration, making connections across vast conceptual distances, seeing potential where others see obstacles. You live in the space of 'what if,' constantly birthing new realities through the sheer audacity of imagination. Your thinking has no natural limits - each idea spawns ten more, each solution reveals new problems worth solving, each answer generates deeper questions. You are the expansion pack of human consciousness, always upgrading the operating system, always discovering new territories to explore. Others depend on you to break them out of limiting assumptions, to show them possibilities they never considered, to demonstrate that the current situation is never the only situation. Your strength lies in this fearless creativity, this willingness to leap before looking, to trust that new ground will appear beneath your feet. The challenge is learning to choose among infinite options, to sometimes go deep rather than wide, to occasionally let an idea mature before moving to the next one. Your gift to the world is the constant reminder that reality is far more plastic than most dare to believe."
