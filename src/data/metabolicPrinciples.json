      "contentlessPrinciple": {
        "title": "Contentless Principle",
        "description": "Metabolism focuses on 'how' information is processed, not 'what' information is processed. Metabolism is void of specific contents, behaviors or beliefs but is the framework that generates all contents in a person. No specific belief or behavior belongs exclusively to any type or function.",
        "source": "Jung: 'The superior function is always the expression of the conscious personality, its aim, its will, and its achievement, whilst the inferior functions belong to the things that simply \"happen\" to one' (CW 6, ¶513)",
        "practicalImplications": "This principle explains why people of the same type can have vastly different beliefs, careers, and lifestyles while maintaining the same underlying information processing patterns. In team building, this means focusing on metabolic compatibility rather than shared opinions or backgrounds.",
        "clinicalApplications": "Therapeutic interventions focus on metabolic flow patterns rather than specific behavioral changes, leading to more sustainable psychological development.",

      "cognitiveHolismPrinciple": {
        "title": "Cognitive Holism Principle",
        "description": "All beliefs, opinions and behaviors are available to all types, but are accessed via different metabolic pathways. Via the combined processing of each type's metabolic functions, every person has direct or indirect access to each kind of psychic experience.",
        "source": "Jung: 'Though all the functions exist in every psyche, one function is invariably more consciously developed than the others' (Psychological Types, CW 6)",
        "practicalImplications": "Every person can access all cognitive abilities through their metabolic pathways, but with different levels of energy efficiency and conscious control. This supports developmental approaches that honor natural strengths while building capacity in weaker areas.",
        "workplaceApplications": "Team composition should ensure metabolic diversity so that all information processing approaches are represented, rather than assuming certain types cannot perform specific roles.",

      },
      "distinctOntologyPrinciple": {
        "title": "Distinct Ontology Principle",
        "description": "While any belief or behavior is accessible to every person, each type carries a distinct phenomenology, born from a different registration of the ontology of objects. This leads to implicit ontological biases forming around the nature of reality. These implicit biases are present even when explicit opinions appear to run contrary to them on the surface.",
        "source": "Jung: 'Two people see the same object, but they never see it in such a way that the images they receive are identical... there often exists a radical difference, both in kind and in degree, in the psychic assimilation of the perceptual image' (CW 6, ¶374)",
        "practicalImplications": "Understanding different ontological biases prevents misattribution of disagreements to personality conflicts when they stem from fundamentally different ways of registering reality. This is crucial for conflict resolution and communication strategies.",
        "neuroscienceBasis": "Brain imaging studies show different neural pathway activation patterns when processing the same information, supporting the biological basis of distinct ontological registration.
