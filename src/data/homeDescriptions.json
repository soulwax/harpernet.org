      "This platform presents an academic expansion of Jungian cognitive function theory, integrating it with contemporary neuroscience research. While grounded in peer-reviewed studies and clinical observations, personality typology should be understood as a framework for understanding, not a definitive categorization system.",
      "The metabolic framework presented here synthesizes Jung's original theories with modern information processing models and should be considered theoretical until further empirical validation. Individual differences are complex and multifaceted, extending far beyond any single typological system.",
