          <p>
            MBTI Sister Types is a passion project designed to explore the
            nuanced differences between Myers-Briggs personality types that
            share the same cognitive functions but in a different order. Sister
            types (those with the same letters except for J/P) offer fascinating
            insights into how slight changes in cognitive function stacking can
            create distinctly different personality expressions.
          </p>
          <p>
            This comparison tool helps enthusiasts understand the subtle
            distinctions between personality types that often get confused with
            one another, providing clarity through side-by-side analysis of
            their approaches, strengths, and characteristic behaviors.

          <p>
            This project was created by a programmer at heart who prefers to
            remain anonymous online, using the pseudonym "soulwax" â€“ named after
            the influential Belgian electronic band.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like the band known for their innovative remixes and genre-blending
            approach, this project aims to remix our understanding of
            personality type dynamics by highlighting the unique qualities that
            emerge from different cognitive function arrangements.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a background in software engineering and a fascination with
            personality psychology, the creator built this resource to make
            complex psychological concepts more accessible and visually
            comparable.

            This application is built with SolidJS for its exceptional
            performance and simplicity, combined with Vite for lightning-fast
            builds. The project uses CSS modules for component-scoped styling
            and a clean, responsive design that works across all devices.
          </p>

            The entire project is open-source under the GPL-3.0 license, and
